## Usage

1) The first time it is launched it will create a template file where the *FIND* and *REPLACE* statements should be placed.

2) Use the splitter sintax (by default it is ' => ') to split the *FIND* and *REPLACE* statements, the FIND one goes on the left and the *REPLACE* one on the right:

> Find and replace me => Replaced!

3) Each line will represent a *FIND* and *REPLACE* command, use as many lines as you wish in your template file

4) Save the template file

5) Launch the Replace command by keyboard shortcut, menus or contextual menu.

6) Enjoy!
